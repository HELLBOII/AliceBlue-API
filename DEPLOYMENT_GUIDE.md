# Deployment Guide for Alice Blue API

## Current Issue
Your API is hosted at [https://alice-blue-api.vercel.app/](https://alice-blue-api.vercel.app/) but Vercel is not suitable for Python Flask APIs with WebSockets.

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Railway (Recommended)
Railway is perfect for Python Flask apps and supports WebSockets.

**Steps:**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Railway will automatically detect your Python app
4. Deploy your `server.py` file
5. Railway will give you a URL like `https://your-app.railway.app`

**Configuration:**
```bash
# For Railway deployment
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://your-app.railway.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_BASE_URL=wss://your-app.railway.app
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Option 2: Render
Render also supports Python Flask apps with WebSockets.

**Steps:**
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Create a new Web Service
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Set build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Set start command: `python server.py`

### Option 3: Heroku
Heroku is a classic choice for Python apps.

**Steps:**
1. Create a `Procfile` in your project root:
   ```
   web: python server.py
   ```
2. Deploy to Heroku
3. Heroku will give you a URL like `https://your-app.herokuapp.com`

### Option 4: DigitalOcean App Platform
Good for production deployments.

## Current Local Development Setup

For now, your app is configured to work locally:

**API Endpoints:** `http://localhost:8000`
**WebSocket:** `ws://localhost:8000`

**To run locally:**
```bash
python server.py
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file for different environments:

**Local Development:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_BASE_URL=ws://localhost:8000
NODE_ENV=development
```

**Production (after deploying to Railway/Render/Heroku):**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://your-deployed-api.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_BASE_URL=wss://your-deployed-api.com
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Why Vercel Doesn't Work

1. **Vercel is for frontend hosting** - not designed for Python backends
2. **No WebSocket support** - Vercel is serverless
3. **Python Flask needs special configuration** - which is complex on Vercel
4. **404 errors** - because Vercel doesn't know how to handle your API routes

## Next Steps

1. **Choose a hosting platform** (Railway recommended)
2. **Deploy your Python API** to the chosen platform
3. **Update environment variables** with the new API URL
4. **Test the deployment** to ensure everything works

The current localhost setup will work perfectly for development and testing!
